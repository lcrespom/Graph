# Modulator
A graphical modular synthesizer, using the
[Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).

Modulator is a totally static HTML/JS app. It requires a modern browser such as Chrome,
FireFox or Safari, but has no server-side code.

## Usage
- Click any synth node from the palette at the right to add it to the canvas
- Use regular drag & drop to move audio nodes around in the canvas
- To connect two nodes:
	- Place the mouse pointer over the source node
	- Press the shift key
	- Move the mouse pointer to the destination node
		(but don't press the mouse button or you will start dragging the node)
	- Release the shift key to make the connection
- To disconnect two nodes, simply make the same connection again,
	and this time it will be removed
- Use the keyboard to play notes: note **C3** is in `Z`, note **C4** is in `Q`.

You can directly try it out [here](https://lcrespom.github.io/live-coding/).

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. You can reach me via [@lcrespom](https://twitter.com/lcrespom)
on Twitter, or directly within GitHub.

- **Instruments**: please share your synth designs if you want them to be featured
	in the presets section. Just open an issue with the synth's JSON and I will
	evaluate it for inclusion.
- **Themes**: feel free to modify the `main.css` file to change the look & feel as
	much as you like. The app is especially in need of a dark theme. I will
	eventually add a theme selector option so the user can switch among a set of
	available themes.
- **Mobile version**: Modulator works only partially in mobile, and is
	designed and tested for the desktop browser only. For example, there is no way
	to connect, disconnect or remove modules on a mobile or tablet.
	A mobile-specific component layout and UX could be designed indepently, and
	I would take charge of fitting the current components in it.
- **Code**: There are plenty of ways to improve and expand this application,
	just check out the ToDo list below. The code is in TypeScript, but ES6/ES2015 and
	plain old JavaScript are compatible with it.

## ToDo
Check the [ToDo list](https://github.com/lcrespom/Modulator/blob/master/TODO.md)
	for pending bugs, new features, UI improvements, and more.

## SynthLib
The sound generation code of the application is also available as a UI-independent
JavaScript library called
[SynthLib](https://github.com/lcrespom/Modulator/blob/master/synthlib.md).
With it, you can load instruments that have
been previously designed with Modulator and play notes on them.


## Browser limitations
1. Modulator has been tested to work in Chrome, FireFox and Safari.
	Although Web Audio is available in most mobile platforms, only the desktop
	version has been tested. Node drag & drop and connection will probably not work
	in the mobile browsers.

2. The **Line In** node is not supported in Safari. Chrome should work, but if
	fails, try with FireFox.

3. FireFox consumes a huge amount of CPU when Modulator is running. It is probably
a consequence of how Web Audio is implemented in FF.
